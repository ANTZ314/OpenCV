# OpenCV
---------

#### pedestrian:  
* motionDet - Uses OpenCV to detect and draw bounding box around motion found in input video (camera?)
* pedestrianDet - Detects all pedestrians found in an inputs image / multiple images
* surveillance - 
* Track - missing?
 
#### imageScrape:  
* google - 
* timecoverspider - removed for completion (Document/Personal)

#### colour:  
* Detect - 
* Games - Example extracting Red/Grey/Yellow/Blue from image of Game cartridges

#### Digit_Rec:  
* CreditCard - Extract digits from image of a credit card
* digitRec - Extract digts from hand-written characters
* Handwriting_Database - 
* LiPlate_Rec - Extract the characters from a license plate
* tesseract - 
* vidRec - 

#### FaceCnt:  
* single project - Facial counter from still image, concatenates number of faces to text file

#### FaceDet:  
* FaceDet1 - Detect faces in still image; Version 01
* FaceDet2 - Detect faces in still image; Version 02

#### FaceRec:  
* GetFaces - Manual way of acquiring a facial dataset (using 'k' to capture) 
* PyImageRec - Using the "encodings.pickle" file, it will infer trained faces in still/camera/video
* RasFaceRec - Same as PyImageRec but modified for Raspberry Pi inference
* YaleFaces - Untested means of deep learning to recognise face from "Yale Faces" dataset

#### PyImageSearch Course Content:  
*  Chapter03 - 11

#### SecuriCam:  
* motion-det - 
* surveillance - 

#### video:  
* playback - Simple playback of input video file
* video - Also playback video file?
* webcam - Open default webcam and diplay onscreen

#### z-Test:
To test specific code sections such as:

* Bash - Running a bash file from python script
* coins - C/Python using opencv to find contours and outline the edges of coins
* contrast - Extreme contrasting of images for use in contour finding later
* crop - Cropping objects from input images
* FaceTest - Not sure?
* Games - Find 4 selected colours from the same input image (Mentioned above)
* PiCam - Not sure?
* Resize - Resize all images in a given path. New size is set in code.
