**note**: All sample images and videos mvoe to home folder to avoid large uploads to Github

#### pedestrian:  
* motionDet - Displays 3 windows for tracking motion (frame, threshhold & frameDelta)
* pedestrianDet
	* Locates pedestrians in parsed image folder, draws bounding box and prints number of pedestrians found. 
	* Displays before and after images comparison of Non-Maxima Suppression with overlapping threshold.
* surveillance - Specifically written for Raspberry Pi - PiCamera
* Track
	* detect1.py - Opens images and detects pedestrians in each and corrects for false positives
	* detect2.py - Opens parsed video file detects pedestrian. Multiple false positives and EXTREMELY slow frame rate.
	* detect3.py - Opens default camera, finds motion & draws bounding box. Prints date/time every 50 detected frames
 
#### imageScrape:  
* google - 
* timecoverspider - 

#### colour:  
* Detect
	* detect1.py - Opens parsed image and detects 4 colors and filters the color while overlaying the colours name
	* detect2.py - Opens parsed image and detects 4 colors and filters the color while overlaying the colours name (names overlap eachother)
	* detect3 - same as detect1.py (code variation)
* Games
	* find_games1.py - Opens parsed image and detects 4 colors and filters the color
	* find_games2.py - Opens parsed image and detects 4 colors and filters the color
