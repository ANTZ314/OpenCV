# OpenCV Project Concepts:
==========================

#### Image Scaling with Open CV:
* Calculate dimensions of key features appearing in still images (PNG’s, JPG’s). 
* Identification and measurement of these features
by CV recognition code, but for best accuracy and correct feature selection, the identity and 
[dimensions of the feature will need to be confirmed manually using movable markers.]

#### Image Comparison:
* Compare two images of the same dimensions and output a third image as a result

#### Object Detection/Recognition:
* Deep Larning sample training, or with CV directly
* Transfer trained models to RasPi type platform for scaled detection
* Object counting
* Find similar objects (web-scraping) - price check by image
* Fault detection - eye inspection

#### Object tracking:
* Projectile motion prediction
* Gate recognition

#### OCR:
* Document data capturing & transfer/update
* Credit card authentication
* Camera documnet scanning & conversion to new format (PDF, text, etc)
* Number plate detection & recognition. Security, tracking
* Spell & language check - school marking [natural language processing]

#### Facial Detection & Recognition:
* still and real-time
* people counting
* Facial landmarks - drowsiness detection
* Age & gender identification
* Emotion identification

#### Camera effects:
* Long exposure
* time lapse
* Deep Dream effects
* Still image auto-scaling and post processing for training data
